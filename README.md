# Service Template

This is designed to get a serverless microservice up and running quickly.

Change names in `package.json`,  `sst.config.ts` and in the database files to your service name to set up. Run `npm run build` to build your database constructs locally. Ensure `AWS_PROFILE` is set in your terminal before doing so.
